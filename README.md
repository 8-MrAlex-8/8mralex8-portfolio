# 🧑‍💻 React Portfolio – WIP

A **personal portfolio** website built using **React.js** and **Vite**, designed to showcase my skills, projects, and online presence. This project follows a **component-focused development structure** for better modularity and scalability.

> 🚧 This project is a work in progress. Deployment is not yet live.
